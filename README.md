## How to use

Clone the repo, and run `python setup.py py2app`, it will create the `.app` application file inside `dist` folder. Open the application file and enjoy clippy!

> Note: If you are using macOS 10.7 or later, the Apple-supplied Tcl/Tk 8.5 still has serious bugs that can cause application crashes. If you wish to use IDLE or Tkinter, install and use a newer version of Python and of Tcl/Tk. Use [this](https://www.tcl.tk/doc/howto/compile.html) link to update.
